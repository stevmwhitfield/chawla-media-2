## About Sunishth Chawla

> "It all started when my dad would have me use his huge DSLRs to take pictures of the family. Every time I would take a picture, it would be blurry, uncentered, and nowhere near professional. Over the course of five years, I have developed the technique of photography; whether it be of cars, human subjects, or nature. Having just bought my first, "very own" camera, I have finally gotten the freedom to travel to many parts of the country that I never knew existed. Since then, I have been clicking away and satisfying not only my clientele, but my own self as well.

> Alongside being your photographer, I want to teach you what it is like to pick up a hobby like mine and actually be able to go forth with it. The process of picking up a camera and taking a picture is intricate enough, but there is a lot behind behind the scenes that goes on to capture that vivid shot that we want to show our friends, family, and the whole world."
